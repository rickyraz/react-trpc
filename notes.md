to connect client and server
we can add a "main" attribute in package.json inside api-server folder
to refer the main "package" we want to add
and then using "yarn add {json-filename@version}" example "yarn add api-server@"1.0.0""

in Api server : trpc/server, zod, cors
in Client : trpc/client, trpc/react, zod
